# To-Do List in Python

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in Python. It allows users to view, add, and remove tasks from their to-do list. This project is perfect for beginners to get familiar with Python functions and basic list operations.

## Features

- **View Tasks:** Users can view the current tasks in their to-do list.
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Remove Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the list by specifying the task number.
- **Simple Interface:** The application uses a command-line interface with options to navigate through the menu.

## Why Use Functions?

Each feature in this application is implemented as a separate function. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Modularity:** Each function handles a specific task, making the code easier to manage, understand, and debug.
2. **Reusability:** Functions can be reused in different parts of the program or in future projects without rewriting the same code.
3. **Readability:** By breaking down the program into functions, the code becomes more readable and easier to follow, especially for beginners.
4. **Scalability:** If you want to expand the application with new features, adding new functions will keep the code organized and maintainable.

This modular design also helps in separating the logic of each feature, which is a good practice in software development.
