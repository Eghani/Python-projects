# Change String Input into Number for Better Optimization

## Mapping:
- `1 -> Stone`
- `2 -> Paper`
- `3 -> Scissors`

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **We will play this game with the computer**.
2. **Generate a random number** between `1`, `2`, and `3`.
3. **Take user input**.
4. **Convert the input into a number**.
5. **Create a dictionary** to optimize the code by mapping:
    - `1 -> Stone`
    - `2 -> Paper`
    - `3 -> Scissors`
6. **Comparison with all possibilities**.
